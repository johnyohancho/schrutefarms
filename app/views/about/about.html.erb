<p class="center">
  Founded in 1812, Schrute Farms is located in the heart of Pennsylvania and is owned and operated by Dwight Schrute. Thanks to the passing
  of his Aunt Shirley, the farm now resides on 1,660 acres of land. The northernmost battle of the Civil
  War was fought here, serving as a  safe haven for artists and poets. Schrute Farms offer a wide range of
  activities for our guests to choose from. These include plowing fields, making tables, beet wine
  classes, mattress making, and tours of the slaughterhouse. Book your next vacation at Schrute Farms!
